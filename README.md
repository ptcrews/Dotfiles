# Dotfiles
A collection of dotfiles for Linux programs/utilities. The directory
structure is subject to change. Note that for each top-level file, there is a
corresponding manifest file ("filename.man") that lists the location where
the file should be located. If there is no manifest file, we assume a default
location of ~/ for the file location.

# dotfiles/shells
The directory containing the configuration files for various shells (bash/zsh/etc)

# dotfiles/editors
Contains the configuration files for various editors (vim mostly).

# dotfiles/wms
The directory for window manager configuration files (e.g. i3)

# dotfiles/x11
The directory containing various Xresource and Xorg files. Note that 
.Xresource includes a number of files from other locations.

# dotfiles/terminals
Configuration files for various terminals and terminal emulators (e.g. xterm,
urxvt, tmux).
